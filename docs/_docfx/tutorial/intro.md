Here you will find а [My Tested ASP.NET Core MVC](https://mytestedasp.net/Core/Mvc) tutorial, in which you will learn the most important parts of the testing framework. In less than 15 minutes you will be able to write fast, asynchronous and high-quality tests against the popular Microsoft web framework. 

We will use:

 - [Music Store](https://github.com/aspnet/MusicStore) - the official ASP.NET Core MVC sample - download it from [HERE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/master/docs/files/MusicStore-Tutorial.zip)
 - Visual Studio Community - the best ASP.NET Core IDE - available [HERE](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
 - .NET Core CLI - the command line tools for .NET Core - get them from [HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
 - xUnit - asynchronous C# test runner - more information [HERE](http://xunit.github.io/)
 - Moq - mocking framework for .NET - more information [HERE](https://github.com/moq/moq4)
 - My Tested ASP.NET Core MVC - fluent assertion framework - more information [HERE](https://mytestedasp.net/Core/Mvc)

The Music Store project is perfectly suitable for the tutorial because it contains commonly used components of a typical ASP.NET Core MVC web application - Entity Framework Core database, authenticated users, session, caching, services and more.
 
If you prefer, you may use any other C# IDE. A good alternative is the cross-platform [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

If you do not want to use xUnit, you may try [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/dotnet-test-nunit) or [MSTest](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/09/01/announcing-mstest-v2-framework-support-for-net-core-1-0-rtm/). See the library's [samples](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/tree/development/samples) in order to understand how to use them with My Tested ASP.NET Core MVC.
