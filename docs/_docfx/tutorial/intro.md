Here you will find Ð° [My Tested ASP.NET Core MVC](https://mytestedasp.net/Core/Mvc) tutorial for version 2.2, in which you will learn the most important parts of the testing framework. In less than 15 minutes you will be able to write fast, asynchronous and high-quality tests against the popular Microsoft web framework.

We will use:

 - [Music Store](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/tree/master/src/MusicStore) - the official ASP.NET Core MVC sample - download it from [HERE](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/raw/development/docs/files/MusicStore-Tutorial.zip)
 - Visual Studio Community - the best ASP.NET Core IDE - available [HERE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/tr/vs/community/)
 - .NET Core CLI - the command line tools for .NET Core - get them from [HERE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
 - xUnit - asynchronous C# test runner - more information [HERE](https://xunit.net/)
 - Moq - mocking framework for .NET - more information [HERE](https://github.com/moq/moq4)
 - My Tested ASP.NET Core MVC - fluent assertion framework - more information [HERE](https://mytestedasp.net/Core/Mvc)

The Music Store project is perfectly suitable for the tutorial because it contains commonly used components of a typical ASP.NET Core MVC web application - Entity Framework Core database, authenticated users, session, caching, services and more.

If you prefer, you may use any other C# IDE. A good alternative is the cross-platform [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

If you do not want to use xUnit, you may try [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit) or [MSTest](https://github.com/microsoft/testfx). See the library's [samples](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/tree/development/samples) in order to understand how to use them with My Tested ASP.NET Core MVC.
