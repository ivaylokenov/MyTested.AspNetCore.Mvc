## Project Description

**MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** is a strongly-typed unit testing library providing an easy fluent interface to test the [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) framework, perfectly suitable for both MVC and API scenarios. It is testing framework agnostic so that you can combine it with a test runner of your choice (e.g. [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit), [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit), etc.). 

*Windows:* [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3xlag3a7f87bg4on?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ivaylokenov/mytested-aspnetcore-mvc)

*Ubuntu & Mac OS:* [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc) 

*Downloads:* [![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/version-2.2/tools/test-sample.gif" />

**MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** has [more than 500 assertion methods](https://MyTestedASP.NET/Core/Mvc/Features) and is 100% covered by [more than 2500 unit tests](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/tree/version-2.2/test). It should work correctly. Almost all items in the [issues page](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/issues) are expected future features and enhancements.

**MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** helps you speed up the testing process in your web development team! If you find that statement unbelievable, these are the words which some of the many happy **MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** users once said: 
> "I’ve been using your packages for almost 3 years now and it has saved me countless hours in creating unit tests and wanted to thank you for making this. I cannot imagine how much code I would have had to write to create the 450+ and counting unit tests I have for my controllers."

> "I absolutely love this library and it greatly improved the unit/integration test experience in my team."

> ["Amazing library, makes you want to do test-driven development, thanks!"](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/issues/265#issue-194578165)

> "Wanted to thank you for your effort and time required to create this. This is a great tool! Keep up the good work."

## Quick Start

This quick start is for ASP.NET Core 3.1. For previous versions, check the [corresponding branches](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/branches).

To add **MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** to your solution, you must follow these simple steps:

1. Create a test project.
2. Reference your web application.
3. Install **`MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc.Universe`** (or just the [testing packages](#package-installation) you need) from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc.Universe/).
4. Create a `testsettings.json` file at the root of the test project, set its `Copy to Output Directory` property to `Copy if newer`, and set your required application settings to fake ones:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "My Fake Connection String"
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

5. Your test project's `.csproj` file should be similar to this one:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <None Update="testsettings.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </None>
  </ItemGroup>
	
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc.Universe" Version="3.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk" Version="16.4.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="xunit" Version="2.4.1" /> <!-- Can be any testing framework --> 
    <PackageReference Include="xunit.runner.visualstudio" Version="2.4.1" />
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\MyApp\MyApp.csproj" /> <!-- Reference to your web project --> 
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

6. Create a `TestStartup` class at the root of the test project to register the dependency injection services, which will be used by all test cases in the assembly. A quick solution is to inherit from the web project's `Startup` class. By default **MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** replaces all ASP.NET Core services with ready to be used mocks. You only need to replace your own custom services with mocked ones by using the provided extension methods. 

```c#
namespace MyApp.Tests
{
    using MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    
    using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

    public class TestStartup : Startup
    {
        public void ConfigureTestServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            base.ConfigureServices(services);
            
            // Replace only your own custom services. The ASP.NET Core ones 
            // are already replaced by MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc. 
            services.Replace<IService, MockedService>();
        }
    }
}
```

7. Create a test case by using the fluent API the library provides. You are given a static `MyMvc` class from which all assertions can be easily configured:

```c#
namespace MyApp.Tests.Controllers
{
    using MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    
    using MyApp.Controllers;
    using Xunit;

    public class HomeControllerShould
    {
        [Fact]
        public void ReturnOkWithCorrectModelWhenCallingAuthenticatedIndexAction()
            => MyMvc                                             // Start a test case.
                .Controller<HomeController>(instance => instance // Arrange the controller under test.
                    .WithUser("TestUser")                        // Set an authenticated user to the request.
                    .WithData(MyTestData.GetData()))             // Populate the application DbContext.
                .Calling(c => c.Index())                         // Act - invoke the action under test.
                .ShouldReturn()                                  // Assert action behavior.
                .Ok(result => result                             // Validate the action result type.
                    .WithModelOfType<List<MyResponseModel>>()    // Check the response model type.
                    .Passing(model => model.Count == 10));       // Assert specific model properties. 
    }
}
```

Basically, **MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** throws an unhandled exception with a friendly error message if the assertion does not pass and the test fails. The example uses [xUnit](http://xunit.github.io/), but you can use any other framework you like. See the [samples](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/tree/version-2.2/samples) for other types of test runners and `Startup` class configurations.

## Detailed Documentation

It is **strongly advised** to read the [tutorial](http://docs.mytestedasp.net/tutorial/intro.html) or watch [this online video lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf2P-410Za4) to get familiar with **MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** in more details. Additionally, you may see the [testing guide](http://docs.mytestedasp.net/guide/intro.html) or the [API reference](http://docs.mytestedasp.net/api/index.html) for a full list of available features.

You can also check out the [provided samples](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/tree/version-2.2/samples) for real-life ASP.NET Core MVC application testing.

## Test Examples

Here are some examples of how **powerful** the fluent testing API actually is! 

**MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** is so **awesome** that each test can be written in **one single line** like in this [application sample](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc/tree/version-2.2/samples/Blog)!

### Controller Integration Tests

A controller integration test uses the globally registered services from the `TestStartup` class:

```c#
// Instantiates controller with the registered global services,
// and mocks authenticated user,
// and tests for valid model state,
// and tests for added by the action view bag entry,
// and tests for view result and model with specific assertions.
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Instance(instance => instance
        .WithUser(user => user
            .WithUsername("MyUserName")))
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction(myRequestModel))
    .ShouldHave()
    .ValidModelState()
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldHave()
    .ViewBag(viewBag => viewBag
        .ContainingEntry("MyViewBagProperty", "MyViewBagValue"))
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldReturn()
    .View(result => result
        .WithModelOfType<MyResponseModel>()
        .Passing(model =>
        {
            Assert.AreEqual(1, model.Id);
            Assert.AreEqual("My property value", model.MyProperty);
        }));

// Instantiates controller with the registered global services,
// and sets options for the current test,
// and sets session for the current test,
// and sets DbContext data for the current test,
// and tests for added by the action cache entry,
// and tests for view result with specific model type.
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Instance(instance => instance
        .WithOptions(options => options
            .For<MyAppSettings>(settings => settings.Cache = true))
        .WithSession(session => session
            .WithEntry("MySession", "MySessionValue"))
        .WithData(data => data
            .WithEntities(entities => entities
                .AddRange(MyDataProvider.GetMyModels()))))
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction())
    .ShouldHave()
    .MemoryCache(cache => cache
        .ContainingEntry(entry => entry
            .WithKey("MyCacheEntry")
            .WithSlidingExpiration(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10))
            .WithValueOfType<MyCachedModel>()
            .Passing(cacheModel => cacheModel.Id == 1)))
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldReturn()
    .Ok(result => result
        .WithModelOfType<MyResponseModel>());

// Instantiates controller with the registered global services,
// and tests for valid model state,
// and tests for saved data in the DbContext after the action call,
// and tests for added by the action temp data entry with а specific key,
// and tests for redirect result to a specific action. 
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction(new MyFormModel
    {
        Title = title,
        Content = content
    }))
    .ShouldHave()
    .ValidModelState()
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldHave()
    .Data(data => data
        .WithSet<MyModel>(set => set 
            .Should() // Uses FluentAssertions.
            .NotBeEmpty()
            .And
            .ContainSingle(model => model.Title == title)))
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldHave()
    .TempData(tempData => tempData
        .ContainingEntryWithKey(ControllerConstants.SuccessMessage))
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldReturn()
    .Redirect(result => result
        .To<AnotherController>(c => c.AnotherAction()));
```

The last test uses [Fluent Assertions](https://github.com/fluentassertions/fluentassertions) to further enhance the testing API. Another good alternative is [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly).

### Controller Unit Tests

A controller unit test uses service mocks explicitly provided in each separate assertion: 

```c#
// Instantiates controller with the provided service mocks,
// and tests for view result.
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Instance(instance => instance
        .WithDependencies(
            serviceMock,
            anotherServiceMock,
            From.Services<IYetAnotherService>())) // Provides a global service.
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction())
    .ShouldReturn()
    .Accepted();
    
// Instantiates controller with the provided service mocks,
// and tests for view result.
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Instance(instance => instance
        .WithDependencies(dependencies => dependencies
            .With<IService>(serviceMock)
            .WithNo<IAnotherService>())) // Provides null for IAnotherService.
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction(From.Services<IYetAnotherService>())) // Provides a global service.
    .ShouldReturn()
    .View();
```

### Route Tests

A route test validates the web application's routing configuration, without executing the defined filters:

```c#
// Tests a route for correct controller, action, and resolved route values.
MyRouting
    .Configuration()
    .ShouldMap("/My/Action/1")
    .To<MyController>(c => c.Action(1));

// Tests a route for correct controller, action, and resolved route values
// with post request and submitted form.
MyRouting
    .Configuration()
    .ShouldMap(request => request
        .WithMethod(HttpMethod.Post)
        .WithLocation("/My/Action")
        .WithFormFields(new
        {
            Title = title,
            Content = content
        }))
    .To<MyController>(c => c.Action(new MyFormModel
    {
        Title = title,
        Content = content
    }))
    .AndAlso()
    .ToValidModelState();

// Tests a route for correct controller, action, and resolved route values
// with post request and JSON body.
MyRouting
    .Configuration()
    .ShouldMap(request => request
        .WithLocation("/My/Action/1")
        .WithMethod(HttpMethod.Post)
        .WithJsonBody(new
        {
            Integer = 1,
            String = "Text"
        }))
    .To<MyController>(c => c.Action(1, new MyJsonModel
    {
        Integer = 1,
        String = "Text"
    }))
    .AndAlso()
    .ToValidModelState();
```

*Note: route tests do not execute action filters.*

### Pipeline tests

A pipeline test provides strongly-typed assertions for the MVC pipeline (from routing to action result, including the application filters):

```c#
// Tests a route for correct route values, 
// and validates whether the controller action 
// with an authenticated user and the provided data
// returns redirect result to a specific action,
// while resolving services from the `TestStartup` class.
MyMvc
    .Pipeline()
    .ShouldMap(request => request
        .WithLocation("/My/Action/1")
        .WithMethod(HttpMethod.Post)
        .WithUser()
        .WithAntiForgeryToken()
        .WithJsonBody(new
        {
            Integer = 1,
            String = "Text"
        }))
    .To<MyController>(c => c.Action(1))
    .Which(controller => controller
        .WithData(MyDataProvider.GetMyModels()))
    .ShouldReturn()
    .Redirect(redirect => redirect
        .To<AnotherController>(c => c.AnotherAction()));

// Tests a route for correct route values, 
// and validates whether the controller action 
// with the provided data
// returns view result with a specific model,
// while resolving services from the provided mocks.
MyMvc
    .Pipeline()
    .ShouldMap("/My/Action/1")
    .To<MyController>(c => c.Action(1))
    .Which(controller => controller
        .WithData(MyDataProvider.GetMyModels())
        .WithDependencies(
            serviceMock,
            anotherServiceMock))
    .ShouldReturn()
    .View(result => result
        .WithModelOfType<MyResponseModel>());
```

*Note: pipeline tests execute action filters.*

*Note: pipeline tests does not run the server middleware configuration.*

*Note: pipeline tests are available from version 3.0.0 onwards.*

### Attribute Declaration Tests

An attribute declaration test validates controller and action attribute declarations:

```c#
// Tests for specific controller attributes - Area and Authorize.
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .ShouldHave()
    .Attributes(attributes => attributes
        .SpecifyingArea(ControllerConstants.AdministratorArea)
        .RestrictingForAuthorizedRequests(ControllerConstants.AdministratorRole));

// Tests for specific action attributes - HttpGet, AllowAnonymous, ValidateAntiForgeryToken, and ActionName.
MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction(With.Empty<int>())) // Provides no value for the action parameter.
    .ShouldHave()
    .ActionAttributes(attributes => attributes
        .RestrictingForHttpMethod(HttpMethod.Get)
        .AllowingAnonymousRequests()
        .ValidatingAntiForgeryToken()
        .ChangingActionNameTo("AnotherAction"));
```

### View Component Tests

All applicable methods are available on the view component testing API too:

```c#
// View component integration test.
MyViewComponent<MyMvcController>
    .Instance(instance => instance
        .WithSession(session => session
            .WithEntry("MySession", "MySessionValue"))
        .WithData(data => data
            .WithEntities(entities => entities
                .AddRange(MyDataProvider.GetMyModels()))))

        .WithDependencies(
            serviceMock,
            anotherServiceMock,

    .InvokedWith(c => c.InvokeAsync(1))
    .ShouldReturn()
    .View();
```

### Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) Tests

**MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** is fully compatible with the AAA testing methodology:

```c#
// Without breaking the fluent API.

MyMvc

    // Arrange
    .Controller<MyMvcController>()
    .WithHttpRequest(request => request
        .WithFormField("MyFormField", "MyFormFieldValue"))
    .WithSession(session => session
        .WithEntry("MySession", sessionId))
    .WithUser()
    .WithRouteData() // Populates the controller route data.
    .WithData(data => data
        .WithEntities(entities => 
            AddData(sessionId, entities)))
            
    // Act
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction(
        From.Services<MyDataContext>(), // Action injected services can be populated with this call.
        new MyModel { Id = id },
        CancellationToken.None))
            
    // Assert
    .ShouldReturn()
    .Redirect(result => result
        .To<AnotherController>(c => c.AnotherAction(
            With.No<MyDataContext>(),
            id)));
            
// With variables.

// Arrange
var controller = MyController<MyMvcController>
    .Instance()
    .WithUser(username, new[] { role })
    .WithData(MyTestData.GetData());
    
// Act
var call = controller.Calling(c => c.MyAction(id));
    
// Assert
call
    .ShouldReturn()
    .Json(result => result
        .WithModelOfType<MyModel>()
        .Passing(model => model.Id == id));
```

### Various Test Examples

Just random **MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc** assertions:

```c#
// Tests whether model state error exists by using a lambda expression
// with specific tests for the error messages,
// and tests whether the action returns view with the same request model.
MyMvc
    .Controller<MyMvcController>()
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction(myRequestWithErrors))
    .ShouldHave()
    .ModelState(modelState => modelState
        .For<MyRequestModel>()
        .ContainingNoErrorFor(m => m.NonRequiredProperty)
        .AndAlso()
        .ContainingErrorFor(m => m.RequiredProperty)
        .ThatEquals("The RequiredProperty field is required."))
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldReturn()
    .View(myRequestWithErrors);

// Tests whether the action throws an exception 
// of a particular type and with a particular error message.
MyMvc
    .Controller<MyMvcController>()
    .Calling(c => c.MyActionWithException())
    .ShouldThrow()
    .Exception()
    .OfType<MyException>()
    .AndAlso()
    .WithMessage()
    .ThatEquals("My exception message");

// Tests whether the action return OK result
// and writes to the response specific content type,
// custom header, and custom cookie.
MyMvc
    .Controller<MyMvcController>()
    .Calling(c => c.MyAction())
    .ShouldHave()
    .HttpResponse(response => response
        .WithContentType(ContentType.ApplicationJson)
        .ContainingHeader("MyHeader", "MyHeaderValue")
        .ContainingCookie(cookie => cookie
            .WithName("MyCookie")
            .WithValue("MyCookieValue")
            .WithSecurity(true)
            .WithHttpOnly(true)
            .WithDomain("mydomain.com")
            .WithExpiration(myDateTimeOffset)
            .WithPath("/")))
    .AndAlso()
    .ShouldReturn()
    .BadRequest();
```
